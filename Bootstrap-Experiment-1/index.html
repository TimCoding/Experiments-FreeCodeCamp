					<li><strong>1726</strong>: Port of Charleston is exporting nearly 4500 metric tons of rice annually until the colnoies gain their independence 50 years later.</li>
					<li><strong>1849</strong>: The gold rush led to the immigration of over 40,000 Chinese workers whose main staple of food was rice. Rice production rose in areas like California.</li>
					<li><strong>1884</strong>: A mechanized revolution took place in the United States that made producing rice easier and more profitable</li>
